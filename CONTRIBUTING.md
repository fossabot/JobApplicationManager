## COOL HACKS

* Open a bugreport on https://dev.azure.com/saigkill/JobApplicationManager/_boards/board/t/JobApplicationManager%20Team/Features .
* Please use the -u flag when generating the patch as it makes the patch more readable.
* Write a good explanation of what the patch does.
* It is better to use git format-patch command: git format-patch HEAD^
